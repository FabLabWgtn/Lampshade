# Langshade
A lampshade I developed based on an existing pattern by RJ Lang

I cut it out of 0.25mm thick cardboard/heavy craftpaper, using an ILS12.150D Universal laser cutter, powered with a 75W laser unit & a bed-size of 1219.2mm x 609.7mmm. I can't remember what that is in Americanese.

### Layout of file

I'm sorry, it's in Illustrator at the moment. One day, I will make it in something else, but I was in a hurry. The page size is equal to the laser bed size. There are five layers in the document and two artboards. Each process has its own layer to make it easier to adjust later, and the second page holds the design for the acrylic piece for the light fitting. (The Universal print driver can deal with more than one artboard)

### Settings

All vectors, print in order. You will see that the PPI for colour blue is down to 10 pulses per inch. This makes a dotted line instead of a continuous line, allowing light to escape as well as making it easier to crease the card in the direction you want it to.

Below are the standard settings I made for this material - to print one with these settings takes 3 minutes and 47 seconds. When I made a larger number of the Langshades, I optimised them. Because the lines are straight(ish) and the material is thin, a little more speed produces similar results. I upped the speed to 18% and the power by 1 - 2%.

### Don't fold this!!

Just crease it. Gently encourage it to be the shape it secretly wants to be. I will add more photos soon.
