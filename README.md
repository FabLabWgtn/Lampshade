# Lampshade - github README

Wendy Neale, Designer and Director of [Fab Lab Wgtn](https://www.fablabwgtn.co.nz/), in New Zealand was the Mentor-in-Residence at [Fab Lab UAE](http://fablabuae.ae/) from January to July 2018, during Fab Academy. In the fifth week of Fab Academy, the Lab hosted the first Mini MakerFaire in the UAE. Fab Lab UAE asked her to design a paper lampshade for some casual workshops that would run during the four-day event. Here is what she did:


  “With everything else going on in the Lab, I found myself with only a couple of days to prepare, so I spent some time cutting and folding paper and trying out some ideas. I needed to work more quickly, so I decided to build on some existing work rather than developing it from the beginning. Looking at the Crease Patterns created by RJ Lang, I decided to adapt the CamphorPot8, opus 679. Referencing this pattern added to the story as I was able to talk about the work he did on the [Deployable Solar Array](https://compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/node/892), where he built on someone else's work, showing the benefit of not starting from zero. RJ Lang's website is full of great patterns that he has developed, and if you look around it, you will find that he has very clear copyright statements. He is open to uses of his patterns for educational purposes as long as you have his written permission and always give credit to him for his crease patterns.

  I drew up a file in Illustrator and tested it and modified it a number of times. One day, I might make it in something else, but I was in a hurry and wasn't too concerned about other people being able to edit it.”

After the four-day event, she collaborated with Etienne Moreau, Technical Demonstrator at [Fab Lab Wgtn](https://www.fablabwgtn.co.nz/) in New Zealand from February to July 2018, to work on the lamp prototype she started and create a 2-hour workshop to help people learn to make their own custom lampshades! Along with the file and material settings, you’ll find the workshop run-sheet including steps to learn how to do it on your own!

## **Machine used**

To create our lamps, we only used a laser cutter (machine/process available in many Fab Labs)

- ours is a ILS12.150D Universal
- powered with a 105W laser unit
- with a bed-size of 1219.2mm x 609.7mmm


## **List of materials for one lamp & materials tested**

So far, we made great lamps out of

- polypropylene (the white model) or craft paper (the dark blue model)
- and acrylic (for the light socket fitting)

*Fab Lab Wgtn Lampshade, made of polypropylene*

To create one lamp and light it up, we recommend getting

- a 500mm x 500mm piece of **0.6mm polypropylene** or **0.35mm colored craft paper**
- a 85mm x 80mm piece of **3mm acrylic**
- a **light bulb** (between 1,800K & 3,000K)
- a **light socket** not too large (we used one with 33mm diameter & found a matching light bulb)
- a **power lead** (prior to buying, think of where you’ll put it & the length you need)

We also tested the following materials without much success

- **0.45mm craft paper was too thick**, it made the creasing too difficult
- **0.15mm & 0.20mm craft paper was too thin**, the final structure couldn’t hold itself

## **Layout of the Lampshade template**

The page size is equal to our laser cutter bed size. There are 6 layers in the document and 3 art-boards (the Universal Laser print driver can deal with more than one art-board). There are also graphic styles already pre-set to prepare the file for laser cutting ( pure red 0.1 pt stroke to cut, pure green 0.1 pt stroke to make creasing lines)

![](/images/image3.jpg)
*what the Lampshade vector template looks like in Illustrator*

The 3 art-boards are:

- art-board 1 - to cut the final lamp
- art-board 2 - to work on your very own lamp design
- art-board 3 - to cut the acrylic fitting

The 6 layers are:

- the notes & black guides (on art-board 1)
- the lamp red cutouts (on art-board 1)
- the lamp green creasing lines (on art-board 1)
- a layer dedicated to prep your design (on art-board 1)
- the acrylic fitting (on art-board 3 - on the right side)
- the logos & credits for the acrylic fitting (on art-board 3 - on the right side)



## **Material settings for the laser cutter**

All vectors, print in order. The settings on the picture are for the 0.6mm polypropylene. For all materials, you will see that the PPI for colour blue is down to 20 pulses per inch. This makes a dotted line instead of a continuous line, allowing light to escape as well as making it easier to crease the card in the direction you want it to, and create a sweet result for your customised illustrations on the petals!

*the Universal laser laser cutter material settings for 0.6mm polypropylene (we used red for cutting and green for creasing lines & our design)*

**→  material 1 - 0.6mm polypropylene (the white model)**


- red lines - cut
  - 50% power
  - 12% speed
  - 500 PPI


- green lines - creasing + custom design
  - 25% power
  - 12% speed
  - 20 PPI

**→  material 2 - 3mm acrylic (the acrylic fitting for the light socket)**


- black areas - raster your logo & name
  - 19% power
  - 100% speed
  - 500 PPI


- red lines - cut
  - 100% power
  - 7.5% speed
  - 1000 PPI

**→  option for material 1 - 0.35mm craft paper (the dark blue model)**

## **Troubleshooting tips before cutting the lamp & the acrylic fitting**


- focus your laser cutter perfectly for each material
- use only perfectly flat materials as much as possible
- cut all green lines (creasing lines & your design) first, then the red lines to avoid material warping and its consequences
- to avoid having burnt traces under your material, you can
  - for polypropylene, put paper towels and gently spray water on the paper before adding the polypropylene on top
  - for craft paper, spread sheets of classic print paper under your material before adding the polypropylene on top


## **Crease the lamp**

Now that our lamp is cut, we want to crease it & gently encourage it to be the shape it secretly wants to be! Don’t try to fold it straight away for it would ruin the result!

![](/images/image6.jpg)
*the creasing instructions*

The top of your lamp will be the outside, while the bottom (with the slight burnt traces from the laser cutter) will be the inside.

- step 1 - crease the pentagon lines from the outside towards the inside
- step 2 - crease the petals edges lines from the outside towards the inside towards the inside
- step 3 - crease the “spikes” edges lines from the inside towards the inside towards the outside
- step 4 - gently squeeze each male latch inside each adjacent female latch
- step 5 - once you’ve attached all the latches together, the lamp should fold itself into its final shape

*what the Lampshade inside looks like once creased and all latches attached*

Remember to take time check the creasing lines around the whole lamp & creasing just a little more where needed to get a nice, consistent symmetrical result!

You now only need to wire it and plug it to see your customised laser-cut lampshade, congratulations :)
