# DIY instructions & workshop runsheet


## **make your custom origami lampshade in 2 hours!**

Inspired from Robert J. Lang’s [CamphorPot8, opus 679](http://www.langorigami.com/crease-pattern/camphorpot8-opus-679) origami pattern, this Lampshade was created in Dubaï by Wendy Neale, while working at [Fab Lab UAE](http://fablabuae.ae/). It was then adapted in Wellington by Etienne Moreau ([Fab Lab Wgtn](https://www.fablabwgtn.co.nz/)) to help anyone custom their own Lampshades & run workshops!

The lamp’s story is a great illustration of what we can make & achieve in an open design world with shared digital fabrication spaces all around the world available to anyone!

----------

**BEFORE MAKING A LAMPSHADE ON YOUR OWN ⚠️**


  - **We recommend buying everything prior to starting these instructions** (for example, you need to know the width of your light socket to set the right dimensions for the acrylic fitting)

  - These **instructions aren’t meant to teach you how to use a laser cutter**! If you don’t know how, [find a local Fab Lab](https://www.fablabs.io/labs) to learn & practice on simple projects first :)

  - if you don’t have one already, **download a vector drawing software like Adobe Illustrator (not free) or Inkscape (free) and learn the basics through tutorials!**

-

**BEFORE RUNNING A LAMPSHADE WORKSHOP ⚠️**


  - get all the materials you need

  - buy matching lights bulbs, sockets & power leads

  - test out the settings for the chosen material on your own machine

  - make a test lamp with your own design to test the whole workflow

  - pre-cut all lamps to save time - cut only one during the workshop to show

  - adapt the acrylic fitting dimensions

  - pre-cut all acrylic fittings to save time - cut only one during the workshop to show

  - turn on the machine, focus on the material & choose the right settings

  - print these instructions for everyone

## 1️⃣  **making & the importance of lighting for well-being - 5 min**

> *read for more context about lighting at home & for well-being, these pictures are taken from* [*The Little Book of Hygge: Danish Secrets to Happy Living*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/29/book-of-hygge-louisa-thomsen-brits-review) *written by Meik Wiking*

- **why make a lamp ourselves instead of buying one?**

  - it’s always an invaluable learning opportunity to make something yourself 🙂

  - using a laser cutter, you’ll get spend a great moment in a local community space

  - you’ll learn to create something, not existing on the market and fitting your needs & personality

  - making locally rather than buying something made abroad & shipped is better for the planet

  - you’ll start taking control back over the objects & physical world around you (invent, repair, adapt, make things again)

-

- **key take-aways about lighting for well-being**

  - the lower the temperature of the light, the best for our eyes & bodies

  - between 3,000K (incandescent lamp) & 1,800K (sunset, candle flame, wood fire) is ideal

  - as much, try to eliminate visual glare, obscure the light source to only emit reflected light

  - instead of having one bright spot in the room, have several warm light spots

  - the position of lighting is the most important thing in your home, more than room layout

  - making & Fab Labs are an opportunity to create lightnings for you & your well-being

## 2️⃣  **find & download free illustrations - 10 min**


  - go to [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/)

  - choose a simple illustration (only outlines, no fill) like “wave” or “arrow”

  - look at the Creative Commons license & talk about why it’s important


  - choose the “Creative Commons” option

  - download the .svg file from The Noun Project

  - open it in Illustrator or Inkscape (free open-source vector drawing software)


  - don’t delete the credits, they’re important - note them / take picture for later reference

  - deleting them and using the design in one of your project just like that = plagiarism!

--

## 3️⃣  **prepare your own lampshade design - 40 min**


> 💡  *we use Adobe Illustrator at Fab Lab Wgtn - hence, the following instructions are named after the Illustrator ones, but you’ll easily find how to do it in another software on Google!*

-

**step 2.1 - “clean” the illustration you just downloaded**

> Functions & tools involved

  - selecting - selecting one object vs. selecting everything
  - erasing, un-do & re-do
  - grouping / ungrouping
  - clipping mask - cancelling
  - compound path - cancelling
  - colors menu - changing the fill color & the stroke color
  - properties menu - changing the stroke weight

> Now in the vector drawing software, make sure you:

  - get rid of all the groups (select everything with ctrl + A & do ctrl + shift + G several times to ungroup everything)
  - get rid of all the compound paths (select everything with ctrl + A & go in the top menu to “object” > “compound path” > “release”)
  - get rid of all the clipping mask (select everything with ctrl + A, right click on the lines & do “cancel clipping mask” if there’s any)
  - get rid of all the double/superposed lines by erasing some lines to see if there’s any doublons hiding underneath it
  - get rid of the fill color, and have a single line stroke

> 💡 *our goal here is to have as few lines as possible, because the more lines we have, the longer it will take to cut. So choose your design wisely to avoid a 1h30 cut time!*

> *examples of illustrations downloaded from The Noun Project and “cleaned” to create our Lampshade design*


  **→  we’re now ready to create your “illustration pattern” over the whole Lampshade**

--

**step 2.2 - explain the layout of Lampshade template**

Now in the vector drawing software, make sure you:


  - open the .ai or .dxf Lampshade template

  - The page size is equal to Fab Lab Wgtn laser bed size (1219 x 609mm). There are 6 layers in the document and 3 artboards (the Universal laser cutter print driver can deal with more than one artboard).

-

  - **The 3 art-boards are**:

    - art-board 1 - to cut the final lamp
    - art-board 2 (below) - to work on your very own lamp design
    - art-board 3 (right) - to cut the acrylic fitting

-

  - **The 6 layers are**:

    - the notes & black guides (on art-board 1)
    - the lamp red cutouts (on art-board 1)
    - the lamp green creasing lines (on art-board 1)
    - a draft layer dedicated to prep your design (on art-board 1)
    - the acrylic fitting (on art-board 3 - on the right side)
    - the logos & credits for the acrylic fitting (on art-board 3 - on the right side)

-

- **The black guides are**:

  - The thin black dotted lines are symetry guides
  - The thick black lines are guides to align your design with the first petal of the Lampshade


![](/images/image3.jpg)

> *what the Lampshade template looks like in Illustrator*

--

**step 2.3 - create your own “petal-sized” design from the illustration you chose**

![](/images/image11.jpg)

> *adapting & replicating our illustration to create a petal-sized design*

-

> Functions & tools involved


  - properties menu - changing scale with ratio
  - rotation tool
  - copying & pasting
  - align menu - changing alignment & distribution
  - graphic styles menu - apply a pre-set graphic style
  - grouping tool - grouping / ungrouping

> Now in the vector drawing software, make sure you:


  - copy & paste your illustration from its original file to art-board 3
  - move it inside the locked black petal model
  - choose the scale of your illustration (in the top menu, go “window” > “properties” > update the width & height and make sure the ratio is maintained)
  - orientate your illustration the right way - petals tops are facing the pentagon center (hit “R” key, click & drag to turn)
  - create an “illustration wallpaper" on the petal by multiplying it (copy, paste & place)
  - align or distribute all your illustrations in a nice way (in the top menu, go “window” > “align”)


  > 💡  *again, the smaller the illustrations are & the more illustrations you have, the longer the cut will be and higher are chances of something going wrong! We’d recommend making your first “test” lamp with a design not too small & not too complex!*


  - still inside the black petal model, now select all your illustrations together
  - go to “window” in the top menu > click on “graphic styles” > select the green outline one
  - this graphic style will set the fill color to clear, the outline color to pure green and the stroke weight to 0.1 pt
  - group them together (use ctrl + G)


  > →  **we’re now ready to apply your petal-sized design onto the 5 petals of the lamp template**

--

**step 2.4 - replicate your custom petal around the Lampshade**

![](/images/image12.jpg)

> *all 3 steps from one illustration to a whole custom Lampshade*

-

> Functions & tools involved


  - copying & pasting in place
  - aligning - custom horizontal center alignment
  - rotation tool - repeat a shape along a circular path
  - layers menu - hiding / displaying a layer

> Now in the vector drawing software, make sure you:

  - select your group of illustrations from the petal model
  - holding shift, select the grouped thick black lines
  - releasing the shift key, click on those black lines again (they should appear thicker)
  - go to the align menu, select the horizontal center alignment
  - you illustrations group should now be over the lamp’s first petal


  - hide the layer with the guides by going to the layer menu and click on the small eye next to the “notes & guides” layer

  - select your illustrations group again
  - hit the “R” key to enter the rotation mode
  - hit “ctrl + Y” to enter the outline view (to see the center of shapes)
  - holding the “alt” key, click on the pentagon inside circle’s center
  - a rotation menu should open
  - you want to set the angle to 72° and click on “copy”
  - hit “ctrl + D” to repeat the last action and place your illustrations group around the Lampshade


  > →  **your custom lamp design is now almost ready to cut :)**

![](/images/image13.jpg)

> *other custom Lampshade designs*

--

**step 2.5 - custom you acrylic fitting to your light socket size**


  - since your light socket width will surely be different from the one we bought, make sure you adapt the diameter of the circle inside the pentagonal acrylic fitting

  - once dimensions are changed, make sure to align it to the horizontal & vertical center of the pentagon with the “align menu”

--

**step 2.6 - make your Lampshade file ready to laser cut**

> Functions & tools involved


  - grouping tool - grouping / ungrouping
  - layers menu - hiding / displaying a layer
  - graphic styles menu - apply a pre-set graphic style

> **Ungroup everything**

  - select the whole lamp
  - move your lamp design to the artboard 1
  - get rid of all the groups (select everything with ctrl + A & do ctrl + shift + G several times to ungroup everything)

> **Check the stroke thickness, color**

  - we need to check the color & stroke thickness for all red + green lines
  - hide all the layers but the “red cutouts” one
  - select everything, go to “graphic styles”, select the red one
  - go to the “properties” menu, the stroke thickness should now be 0.1pt
  - go to the “color” menu, the color should be set to pure red (= 255, 0, 0 on the RGB scale)
  - hide the red layer & unhide the “creasing lines” and the “your design” layers
  - select everything, go to “graphic styles”, select the green one
  - go to the “properties” menu, the stroke thickness should now be 0.1pt
  - go to the “color” menu, the color should be set to pure green (= 0, 255, 0 on the RGB scale)
  - unhide the “red cutouts” layer


  > →  **your custom lamp design is now READY to cut :)**

## 4️⃣  **cut the lamp & acrylic part**


> **Troubleshooting tips before cutting the lamp & the acrylic fitting**


  - **focus your laser cutter** perfectly for each material

  - **use only perfectly flat materials** as much as possible

  - **cut all green lines** (creasing lines & your design) **first**, **then the red lines** to avoid material warping and its consequences

  - to **avoid having burnt traces** under your material, you can
    - for polypropylene, put paper towels and gently spray water on the paper before adding the polypropylene on top
    - for craft paper, spread sheets of classic print paper under your material before adding the polypropylene on top

  - **time your file to know exactly how long it will take** (we recommend 10 min max for a workshop)

> 💡  *don’t forget to actively supervise the machine during the cut! if you’re not confident, better ask someone to check your file and remind you all the health & safety practices ;)*


  - use the laser cutter to cut your custom lamp

  - don’t forget to also cut your acrylic fitting

  - once the cut is done, before touching your material:
    - check if it’s cut all the way through
    - if not, launch a new job only with the red lines (deleting or hiding the green ones)
    - if yes, you can safely remove your material


>  →  **your custom lamp & acrylic fitting are now cut and ready to be creased :)**

----------

## 5️⃣  **crease the lamp**


![](/images/image5.jpg)

> *a ready-to-fold Lampshade & a finished model*


  - Now that our lamp is cut, we want to crease it & gently encourage it to be the shape it secretly wants to be! Don’t try to fold it straight away for it would ruin the result!

![](/images/image6.jpg)

> *the creasing instructions*


  - The top of your lamp will be the outside, while the bottom (with the slight burnt traces from the laser cutter) will be the inside.


- **step 1** - crease the pentagon lines from the outside towards the inside
- **step 2** - crease the petals edges lines from the outside towards the inside towards the inside
- **step 3** - crease the “spikes” edges lines from the inside towards the inside towards the outside
- **step 4** - gently squeeze each male latch inside each adjacent female latch
- **step 5** - once you’ve attached all the latches together, the lamp should fold itself into its final shape

-

![](/images/image6b.jpg)

![](/images/image7.jpg)

> *what the Lampshade inside looks like once creased and all latches attached*


  - Remember to take time check the creasing lines around the whole lamp & creasing just a little more where needed to get a nice, consistent symmetrical result!


>   →  **congratulations, your custom lampshade folded in its final origami flower shape :)**

--

## 6️⃣  **wire the lamp**

> ⛔️ ⚠️  ***Wiring up electrical appliances is a serious matter and the results of an amateur job could be devastating for you & those around you. The Internet is not enough and bad/insufficient advices are too common. So if you’ve never done it before, I very strongly recommend you to seek help in a local Fab Lab or to someone with the right experience / expertise to walk through it.***

The last steps are to:

  - screw the light socket both from the inside and the outside of the acrylic fitting for a nice & strong fit
  - wire up the power lead to the light socket
  - plug the now all wired lampshade
  - enjoy the result!
