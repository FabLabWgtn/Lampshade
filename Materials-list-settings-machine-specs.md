# Materials list, settings and machine specs


## **Machine - laser cutter specs**

To create our lamps, we only used a laser cutter (machine/process available in many Fab Labs)

- ours is a ILS12.150D Universal
- powered with a 105W laser unit
- with a bed-size of 1219.2mm x 609.7mmm

## **Material tests**

So far, we made great lampshades out of

- **0.6mm polypropylene** (the white model) or **0.35mm colored craft paper** (the dark blue model)
- and **3mm acrylic** (for the light socket fitting)

We also tested the following materials for the lamp without much success

- **0.45mm craft paper was too thick**, it made the creasing too difficult
- **0.15mm & 0.20mm craft paper was too thin**, the final structure couldn’t hold itself

## **List of materials for one lamp**

To create one lamp and light it up, we recommend getting

- a 500mm x 500mm piece of **0.6mm polypropylene** or **0.35mm colored craft paper**
- a 85mm x 80mm piece of **3mm acrylic**
- a **light bulb** (between 1,800K & 3,000K)
- a **light socket** not too large (we used one with 33mm diameter & found a matching light bulb)
- a **power lead** (prior to buying, think of where you’ll put it & the length you need)

## **Material settings for the laser cutter**

All vectors, print in order. The **settings on the picture are for the 0.6mm polypropylene**.

**For all materials but the acrylic, you will see that the PPI for colour blue is down to 20 pulses per inch. This makes a dotted line instead of a continuous line**, allowing light to escape as well as making it easier to crease the card in the direction you want it to, and create a sweet result for your customised illustrations on the petals!
